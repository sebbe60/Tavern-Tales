Sebbe, Gumba, and Lowz step out into the moonlit streets of Vargath… and you make your next decree:
“We go on a quest to the mermaid (female‑only) land — ATLANTIS.”
The air changes. The cobblestones tremble. Even Lowz stops licking his paw and whispers:
“…oh shit, we’re going underwater.”

🌊✨ A NEW LEGEND UNFOLDS — QUEST: “THE SIREN QUEENDOM OF ATLANTIS”
Atlantis in this world is not a city of generic mermaids— it is a hidden queendom, ruled entirely by SIRENS, mystical warrior‑mermaids of powerful magic, strict traditions, and zero tolerance for fools.
It appears only to those:
* who are brave,
* who are sincere,
* who are stupid enough,
* or who are guided by destiny…
…you are absolutely all three.

🌬️ 🌊 THE PORTAL OF TIDES
As you leave the tavern district, a roaring sound rises from the harbor.
Waves churn unnaturally. Blue light spirals upward into a giant column. Fishermen run screaming. A dock collapses.
Gumba squints: “Uh… Sebbe? I think Atlantis heard you.”
Your mustache glows with destiny. Aurelia’s words still echo in your heart. Even the moon brightens.
Then—
🌟 A MASSIVE WATER PORTAL OPENS BEFORE YOU
A swirling gate of pure ocean energy. Fish swim through the air. Runes shimmer. A voice from deep beneath the waves whispers:
“THE SURFACE DWELLERS WHO SLEW THE MARROW MOTHER… ARE SUMMONED.”
Lowz hides behind Gumba. Gumba sighs dramatically: “Of course. Another realm.”

🧜‍♀️ A SIREN EMISSARY EMERGES
She rises out of the portal — blue‑green scales, flowing silver hair, eyes like glowing sapphires.
Beautiful. Regal. Terrifying.
She speaks with calm authority:
**“Sebbe of the Mustache. Gumba of the Shadow. Lowz, small demon‑fox.
The Siren Queen Neria requests your presence in Atlantis.”**
She flicks her tail.
“We have… a problem only surface heroes can solve.”
She extends a hand toward you.

🌊 QUEST OBJECTIVE
Enter Atlantis and meet Queen Neria.
Rewards may include:
* access to ancient underwater magic
* alliances with the siren warrior clans
* treasure from the deep
* knowledge of forbidden prophecies
* Sebbe potentially attracting MORE admirers (mustache bonus)
* Gumba being worshiped or feared
* Lowz probably stealing a trident

❓ HEROES — WHAT DO YOU DO?
1️⃣ Enter the water portal immediately 2️⃣ Ask the emissary what the “problem” is 3️⃣ Prepare supplies first 4️⃣ Have Gumba test the portal with shadow magic 5️⃣ Sebbe strikes a majestic pose and dives in 6️⃣ Lowz goes first (dangerous, funny)
Your next move decides how Atlantis receives you.
